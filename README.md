# FRC Mechanism Code Generator

A web-based tool for generating Java code for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) mechanisms like elevators, arms, and pivots.

## Overview

This tool helps FRC teams quickly generate well-structured, command-based Java code for common robot mechanisms. It provides:

- Form-based configuration for mechanism parameters
- Real-time simulation of mechanism behavior
- Generated Java code for subsystems with proper control methods
- Support for different motor controllers (SparkMAX, SparkFlex, TalonFX, TalonFXS, ThriftyNova, Redux Nitro)
- Support for different motor types (NEO, NEO550, Minion, Krakenx44, Krakenx60, Cu60, Cu40)

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Create Java subsystem classes with proper control methods, telemetry, and simulation support
- **Interactive Simulation**: Test and visualize mechanism behavior with adjustable parameters
- **Multiple Mechanism Types**: Support for elevators, arms, and pivots (turrets/wrists)
- **Comprehensive Configuration**: Configure PID values, feedforward constants, soft limits, current limits, and more
- **Static Export**: The site can be built as a static site for easy deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone Yet-Another-Software-Suite/yamg
   cd yamg
   ```pnpm

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. Update the `basePath` in `next.config.mjs` to match your repository name:
   ```javascript
   basePath: '/your-repo-name',
   ```

2. Build and export the static site:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

3. Push the `out` directory to the `gh-pages` branch:
   ```bash
   git add out/ -f
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git subtree push --prefix out origin gh-pages
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use a GitHub Action to automate deployment (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
